Research Rapid API or find API to work with (any-api.com).
Business proposal for a pipeline with that API.

Use Slack's API to send daily SCRUM updates to a chat.
Potentially also allow members to update the bot, 
    such that SCRUM updates can include individual people's progress
http://any-api.com/slack_com/slack_com/docs/_chat_postMessage/chat_postMessage
chat.postMessage

Pipeline would require:
1. A service to read and store incoming messages to the bot
2. A service to process the messages and update the bot's SCRUM data
3. A service to regularly post the SCRUM update to a Slack channel
4. Channels between each of these services

Using the Slack API, their recommendation is an Azure-based 
pipeline, however this could potentially be achieved using Python 
to read and sent messages with the API, combined with Flume or 
Nifi as channels for the data, and a file or database to store 
the SCRUM bot's information.
