Proposal of Pipeline 2 - Due Friday Morning
Create a Kafka producer in Python and have the data stored in Kafka Brokers - Monday

Proposal:
To search for top 10 common keywords among submissions and store those in Hive.
Reddit allows either text or URL submissions, but they always use a title that can be accessed.
Check for the most popular keyword(s) used in those titles.
There's currently no service that can check for common keywords used in reddit submissions,
so this would be a way to check for what's "popular" on a daily basis.
That information could then be used for analytics (e.g. are certain keywords appearing daily, etc).

See: reddit-pipeline git.
